    "I have a Mathematics background, but it has been over 20 years since I have done any Statistics, and even then it was elementary. I have not yet had a chance to review the subject of Statistics in my Data Analyst learning journey so far;  therefore, the analysis below is not statistically rigorous, and I use percentages and averages only. I have also only learned basic Python so far, and so I do not know how to make visualisations of the analyses presented. Basically, this shows how I can import data using the csv library and save it into lists. I maybe should have saved the data into a dictionary to handle the data a bit easier, I don't know. I am still unclear when to use functions and do not have a good understanding of classes, so the use of functions is very sporadic and the use of classes is non-existent. I might come back to this project later to fix this. Anyway, it is what it is at the moment, and I welcome any feedback.\n",

    "Problem(s):\n",
    "How can we help people to reduce their insurance costs, and in so doing, improve their overall health (or vice versa)?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I would like to describe the dataset:\n",
    "1. How many entries are there?\n",
    "2. What percent are male and what percent are female?\n",
    "3. How many people from each region?\n",
    "4. What percentage are smokers?\n",
    "5. How many/what percent of the set have children? 1-2 children? more than 3 children?\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I will compare charges based on different parameters. I am tempted to analyze the charges for each possible parameter, but instead I will focus on the most actionable parameters: bmi, smoking status, and region.\n",
    "1. Categorize bmi according to underweight, ideal weight, overweight, and obese, and find the average insurance cost for each range.\n",
    "2. How do charges differ based on smoking status?\n",
    "3. Do people in different regions have significantly different charges?\n",
    "\n",
    "Also of interest is how the bmi relates to other factors:\n",
    "1. What is average bmi by age range? Perhaps also separate male and female, as bmi can vary between the different genders.\n",
    "2. What is the average bmi by smoking status?\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions that can be taken based on the analyses done.\n",
    "1. How can this help people to reduce their insurance charges?\n",
    "2. How can this help people to be more healthy?"
